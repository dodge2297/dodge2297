I’m a B.Tech Computer Science student who loves to bring ideas to life through code.

🌐 Skilled in HTML, CSS, and Java, and always curious to learn more.

💡 Passionate about creating practical, user-friendly solutions for real-world problems.

## 🧩 Currently delving into:

• Building dynamic websites that are as beautiful as they are functional.

• Enhancing my problem-solving skills one challenge at a time.

• Understanding how technology shapes the future of finance (and testing the waters with crypto).


## 🎯 What keeps me going?

The thrill of turning a blank screen into something meaningful.

The joy of collaborating with people who share a love for innovation.

                                            🌱 Always learning. Always growing. Always building.
